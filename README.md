AWS Lambda Cost Optimizer
Efficiently reduce your AWS Lambda costs! This Python tool analyzes Lambda configurations and suggests concrete optimizations, drawing on real-world cloud best practices. Great for students, engineers, and cloud practitioners seeking scalable solutions.

Features
Analyzes Lambda timeout, memory, and concurrency settings

Provides specific cost-saving recommendations

Clean, extensible Python code

Ready for integration with boto3 for live AWS analysis

Project Motivation
Modern cloud users often overspend on Lambda due to misconfigured resources. I built this to demonstrate real-world, high-value AWS and distributed systems skills relevant for Amazon SDE roles.

Usage
python
from lambda_optimizer import analyze_lambda

config = {
    'timeout': 20,
    'memory': 1024,
    'provisioned_concurrency': False
}
suggestions = analyze_lambda(config)
print(suggestions)
Output:

python
['Reduce timeout: Most Lambdas finish in < 10s.', 'Reduce memory if possible: Costs rise with allocation.', 'Enable provisioned concurrency for predictable workloads.']
Roadmap
Add AWS API integration using boto3

Batch analysis for multiple functions

CLI interface and reporting

Link to CI/CD pipeline example

How to Run
